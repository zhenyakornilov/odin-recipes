  <h2>What Is Chicken Kiev?</h2>
  <p>
    Hails from Eastern Europe, specifically places like Ukraine, and Poland.<br>
    Chicken breast is pounded out, stuffed with a garlic herb compound butter, coated<br>
    with eggs and breadcrumbs, and eventually fried and/or baked. The best part of<br>
    this chicken truly is the filling.
  </p>
  <p>
    You roll the flattened chicken around some garlic herb compound butter and it<br>
    melts when heated up in the oven. My garlic butter is packed full of fresh herbs,<br>
    lots of fresh minced garlic, and some bright lemon juice. With a sinfully rich<br>
    interior, a crispy exterior, and perfectly tender chicken, this dish is hands<br>
    down phenomenal.

  </ul>
  <h4>Chicken Kyiv</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>4 chicken breasts <em>(boneless and skinless)</em></li>
    <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 large eggs <em>(beaten)</em></li>
    <li>1 ½ cups breadcrumbs <em>(such as Panko)</em></li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the garlic herb compound butter:</strong> Mix all the garlic butter<br>
      ingredients together using a fork or a spatula. Place it onto a piece of<br>
      plastic wrap and roll into a log. Place it in the freezer for 30-40<br>
      minutes to freeze. It needs to be firm so that we can slice it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare the chicken:</strong> Lay each breast flat onto your work surface.<br>
      Butterfly the chicken breast by slicing it horizontally. Place the<br>
      chicken breast opened between two pieces of parchment paper or<br>
      plastic wrap and then flatten using a meat mallet. If you don't have a<br>
      meat mallet you can also use the back of a heavy frying pan such<br>
      as a cast iron skillet. Season each breast fillet with salt and pepper<br>
      on both sides.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Assemble the chicken Kyiv:</strong> Cut the frozen butter into 4 equal<br> 
      pieces. Place a frozen piece of garlic butter in the centre of<br>
      a chicken fillet, fold the chicken over the garlic butter, gathering the<br>
      sides to the center to form either a round ball or a log. Wrap each<br>
      chicken piece in plastic wrap and twist the ends to make sure it's<br> 
      wrapped tightly. Place the wrapped chicken pieces in the freezer for<br> 
      about 2 hours until the seams have frozen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Form the breading:</strong> Add the flour onto a shallow plate, crack the<br> 
      eggs in another shallow plate and whisk, and in a third bowl the<br>
      breadcrumbs. Roll the frozen chicken first into the flour and make<br>
      sure it is coated evenly, then roll it into the eggs and finally roll it<br>
      through the breadcrumbs. Repeat with all the chicken pieces.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Finish the dish:</strong> Heat the oil into a large saucepan or Dutch oven to<br> 
      <strong>350 F degrees</strong>. Preheat your oven to <strong>400 F degrees</strong>. Deep fry<br>
      each piece of chicken for 2-3 minutes until golden brown on all<br>
      sides. Transfer the fried chicken into a baking dish such as a 9×13-inch<br>
      casserole dish, then transfer to the oven and bake for <strong>20 to 25 minutes</strong>.
