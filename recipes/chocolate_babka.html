  <h2>What Is a Babka?</h2>
  <p>
    A babka is a traditional braided bread that originated among the Eastern European<br>
    Jewish communities of Ukraine and Poland. ‘Babka’ means grandmother. It is like<br> 
    a sweet Challah or Brioche Bread with ribbons of chocolate (or sometimes cinnamon)<br>
    throughout. These swirls of ganache separate the buttery crumb into melt-in-your-mouth<br>
    layers. It’s a truly delicious baked treat that we love to make for the holidays,<br>
    from Easter to Christmas.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Milk</strong> – The milk for the dough should be warm, but not hot.</li>
    <li><strong>Active Dry Yeast</strong> – Don’t forget to check the dates on your yeast packets to ensure it’s not expired.</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar</strong> – Sugar helps feed the yeast, and sweetens the dough.</li>
    <li><strong>Flour</strong> – I’ve had the best results with regular all-purpose flour.</li>
    <li><strong>Eggs</strong> – remember let them come to room temperature.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Butter</strong> – You’ll need melted butter for the batter as well as for brushing the top<br>
      of the babkas before they’re baked. You can also brush the tops with<br>
      <strong>Coconut Oil</strong> after baking if you’d like.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Salt and Vanilla</strong> – use pure vanilla extract. Salt helps to balance and enhance<br>
      the flavors of the dough.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Chocolate Ganache</strong> – a combination of heavy cream, sugar and semi-sweet<br>
      chocolate chips make the decadent chocolate sauce.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
  <h4>How to Make Chocolate Babka:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, add warm milk,<br>
      sprinkle top evenly with yeast and let sit for 7 min. Whisk in ½ cup flour and 2<br>
      Tbsp sugar. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm oven (100˚F) for<br>
      25-30 min or at room temp 35-45 min until puffed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whisk in eggs, 3 Tbsp melted butter, remaining 2 Tbsp sugar, salt, and vanilla.<br> 
      Using the dough hook on speed 2, add the remaining 3 cups of flour<br> 
      (1/2 cup at a time, letting it incorporate between additions). The dough<br> 
      should feel barely sticky to the touch but should not stick to the sides of the<br>
      mixing bowl. Add an extra 1-2 Tbsp flour if needed. Once all flour is in,<br>
      continue kneading on speed 2 for 8-10 min.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm oven for 1 hr or at room temp 2 hrs,<br>
      until doubled in size. Meanwhile, make the chocolate ganache (instructions below).
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the dough has risen, divide it in half. Generously dust flour on a clean work<br>
      surface and place 1 piece of dough in the center. Sprinkle dough with flour and<br>
      roll into a 12" wide by 16" long rectangle. Spread with 1/3 of the ganache. Roll the<br>
      dough up tightly starting with the shorter side.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 min. Cut each chilled roll in half<br>
      lengthwise with a sharp knife, keeping the top 1/2" of the roll connected. Twist<br>
      halves together a few times.
    </li>
    <li>
      Butter and line 2 loaf pans with parchment paper. Carefully transfer the dough to<br>
      the prepared pans. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 30-45 min<br>
      or at room temp for 1 to 1½ hours or until puffy. Preheat oven to 350˚F.
    </li>
    <li>
      Brush loaves with remaining 1 Tbsp melted butter and Bake at 350˚F on the center rack<br>
      for 30 min or until golden brown. Brush hot loaves with coconut oil to give them a<br>
      sheen or spread the remaining chocolate ganache over the tops.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h4>How to Make Chocolate Ganache:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine heavy whipping cream with 1/4 cup<br> 
      sugar, stirring until dissolved and cream reaches a simmer then remove from heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add chocolate chips to a medium bowl and pour the hot cream over the top, wiggling<br> 
      the bowl around to ensure the chocolate chips are covered. Cover the bowl and let sit<br> 
      for 5 minutes. Uncover and whisk starting from the center and moving outward until a<br>
      smooth chocolate sauce has formed. Cool completely to room temperature or until the<br>
      sauce has thickened. To speed set, refrigerate the ganache for 10 minutes at a time,<br>
      whisking to check the consistency.
